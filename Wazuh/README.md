# Wazuh Home Lab

## Objective

- **Deploy and configure a Wazuh SIEM** on an **Ubuntu VM** to monitor host activity.
  
- **Register a Windows host as an agent** to enable centralized event collection and monitoring.
  
- **Implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** to detect and alert on unauthorized file changes within the Windows system.
  
- **Understand** how the concepts of **endpoint telemetry, rule-based detection, and alert correlation** work in a real-world environment.

### Skills Learned

- **SIEM Deployment & Configuration**: Installed and configured the Wazuh server on Ubuntu and connected it with the web UI (via Wazuh Dashboard). 

- **Agent Registration**: Added and configured the Windows host as a Wazuh agent, establishing secure communication with the Wazuh manager. 

- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**: Implemented FIM rules to monitor file changes, additions, and deletions on the Windows system. 

### Tools Used

- Ubuntu VM
- Windows Host
- Wazuh

## Findings

- **Agent-to-manager communication was functioning correctly**, as all file events were reflected on the server in real time.

- **FIM rules were correctly configured**, detecting file creation, deletion, and modification events without additional tuning.

- **Wazuh’s alerting pipeline worked end-to-end**, from local agent monitoring → rule evaluation → event forwarding → dashboard visualization.

- **Log metadata provided valuable context**, such as file paths, event types, and timestamps—similar to what security analysts review during investigations.

- **Wazuh can serve as an effective SIEM for endpoint monitoring**, especially for small environments or home labs aiming to understand detection mechanics.

**1. Ubuntu VM: Wazuh Agent Registration**

In my Ubuntu VM, I ensured that the Windows Host is correctly configured as an agent in my Ubuntu VM Wazuh server.

**2. Windows Host: Wazuh Agent Connection Confirmation**

I ensured my Windows Host is connected and running in my Ubuntu VM Wazuh server.

**3. Ubuntu VM: Wazuh Login and Event Review** 

I logged into my Wazuh server and checked File Integrity Management (FIM): Recent events for my Windows Host. 

There are currently no events.

**5. Windows Host: File Deletion**

I deleted Test 1. In my Ubuntu VM, I checked FIM: Recent events for my Windows Host. 

New events are shown below.
