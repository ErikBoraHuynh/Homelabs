# Active Directory Homelab

## Objective

- **Build a functional, small-scale Active Directory environment** to understand how identity, authentication, and central management operate in an enterprise network.

- **Practice deploying and configuring core AD components** such as domain controllers, user accounts, OUs, and administrative tools.

- **Gain hands-on experience automating administrative tasks** with PowerShell.

### Skills Learned

- **Active Directory Deployment & Configuration**: Installed, promoted, and managed a Windows Server domain controller.

- **User, Group & OU Management**: Created accounts, structured OUs, and applied role-based organization.

- **PowerShell Automation**: Automated bulk user creation and administrative tasks using scripts.

### Tools Used

- Windows Server 2019 VM
- Windows 10 VM
- Powershell

## Findings

- **Proper DNS configuration is critical** as misconfigured DNS caused login failures and domain join issues until corrected.

- **Automating user creation in PowerShell is far more efficient** than manually creating accounts in Active Directory Users and Computers.

- **The homelab reinforced how authentication flows in a Windows domain**, particularly the role of the domain controller in verifying credentials.

- **Hands-on practice highlighted how AD environments are structured in real organizations**, making enterprise security concepts easier to understand.

Created an Active Directory Diagram in Microsoft Visio to help visualize this homelab. 

The Windows Server 2019 VM functions as the Domain Controller (DC) for the internal network, providing centralized authentication, identity management, and network services. Both the Domain Controller and the Windows 10 Client VM reside on the same virtual internal network.

On the Domain Controller, several core enterprise services are configured to replicate a real-world Active Directory environment:

- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) for domain identity and authentication

- DNS for domain name resolution

- DHCP for dynamically assigning IP addresses to domain-connected hosts

- NAT / Routing to provide controlled internet access to internal hosts

The Windows 10 Client VM acts as a company-owned device that relies entirely on the Domain Controller for network connectivity, authentication, and configuration. This mirrors how enterprise systems operate within a centralized domain environment. 

The Domain Controller also handles user and computer account creation, management, and distribution across the domain, ensuring that all domain-joined devices use the same centrally enforced identities, permissions, and policies.

1. In  Oracle VirtualBox, I created and configured my Windows Server 2019 VM to have two different adapters. Adapter 1 has NAT for internet access and Adapter 2 has an Internal Network for the Windows 10 Client VM.

***

2. In my Windows Server 2019 VM, I renamed Adapter 1 (NAT) to INTERNET and Adapter 2 (Internal Network) to X_Internal_X. Assigned Adapter 2 (Internal Network) its own unique IP address, Subnet mask, and Preferred DNS server.

3. In my Windows Server 2019 VM, I opened Server Manager and proceeded to install Active Directory Domain Services, DHCP Server, DNS Server, and Remote Access. I additionally installed .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.7 in the Features section to ensure compatibility.

***

4. In my Windows Server 2019 VM, after all installations were completed, I promoted the server to the Domain Controller, set the root domain name to mydomain.com, and created its password. Restarted the VM.

***

5. In my Windows Server 2019 VM, I logged back in as the newly installed Domain Controller administrator account to create a new Organizational Unit called _ADMINS and create my own specific administrator user account.

**(_ADMINS and _USERS are already there due to me completing the homelab beforehand)**

6. In my Windows Server 2019 VM, I configured Routing and Remote Access to allow devices in the internal network to connect to the internet through the Windows Server 2019 VM/our Domain Controller.

7. In my Windows Server 2019 VM, I configured DHCP following the values in the Active Directory Diagram to allow devices in the internal network to automatically be assigned their own IP address when connecting to the internet through the Windows Server 2019 VM/our Domain Controller.

8. In my Windows Server 2019 VM, I downloaded an example list of 100s of users called names.txt and the PowerShell automation script called 1_CREATE_USERS to automate the user account creation process from https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS. Added my name to the top of the list in names.txt to create a non-admin user account for myself. Opened PowerShell as Administrator and ran the PowerShell automation script directly in PowerShell.

### PowerShell Script Explained

`$PASSWORD_FOR_USERS = "Password1"` sets the password for all users

`$USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST = Get-Content .\names.txt` reads all the names from the names.txt file

`$password = ConvertTo-SecureString $PASSWORD_FOR_USERS -AsPlainText -Force` converts the plain text password into a secure version that AD will accept because Active Directory requires passwords to be in a SecureString format.

`New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name _USERS -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion $false` creates a new OU named _USERS (seen earlier) to store created users in. Also disables protection so you can easily remove it later if needed.

`foreach ($n in $USER_FIRST_LAST_LIST) {` starts a loop that processes each name from the file one user at a time.

`$first = $n.Split(" ")[0].ToLower()`  
`$last  = $n.Split(" ")[1].ToLower()` splits each line into two parts (first and last name) and converts both to lowercase for consistent usernames.

`$username = "$($first.Substring(0,1))$($last)".ToLower()` builds the username using the format: first initial + last name

`Write-Host "Creating user: $($username)" -BackgroundColor Black -ForegroundColor Cyan` prints onto PowerShell, indicating which user is currently being created when the script is run. This is helpful for debugging or tracking progress.

`New-AdUser -AccountPassword $password `
           -`GivenName $first `
           -`Surname $last `
           -`DisplayName $username `
           -`Name $username `
           -`EmployeeID $username `
           -`PasswordNeverExpires $true `
           -`Path "ou=_USERS,$(([ADSI]"").distinguishedName)" `
           -`Enabled $true `

creates a new AD user with:

- Password: the secure password defined earlier

- First & Last Name: pulled from the text file

- Username / DisplayName / EmployeeID: set to the generated username

- Password never expires: useful for a homelab

- Path: places the account in the _USERS OU. The ADSI call ensures the script dynamically detects the domain’s distinguished name (DN), no matter what domain is used (e.g., dc=homelab,dc=local).

- Enabled: immediately activates the account

9. In my Windows Server 2019 VM, I verified the creation of all the user accounts in the Active Directory and additionally filtered for both my accounts within _USERS and mydomain.com.

<img width="882" height="651" alt="9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/818bda59-153a-4ae3-b218-63861c2c3b91" />

10. In Oracle VirtualBox, I created and configured my Windows 10 Client VM to only use an Internal Network for Adapter 1, isolating it so it can communicate only with other machines within the same internal network.

<img width="766" height="474" alt="10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/facd61bc-2c29-45c9-b4b7-bd70c60e5d08" />

11. In my Windows 10 Client VM, when we created the Windows 10 Client VM and configured its adapter to Internal Network, it entered the same Internal Network as our Windows 2019 Server VM / Domain Controller. Since we installed and configured Active Directory Domain Services, DHCP Server, DNS Server, and Remote Access, our Windows 10 Client VM was able to automatically reach out to our Windows 2019 Server VM to request and obtain a unique IP address.

12. In my Windows Server 2019 VM, I verified from the Domain Controller side that DHCP was working and successfully assigned a unique IP address to my Windows 10 Client VM, which aligns with the values we configured (172.16.0.100-200) as shown in the Active Directory Diagram.

<img width="1020" height="289" alt="7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af280646-d517-4c44-a36b-22f3567bdcd1" />

***

13. In my Windows 10 Client VM, we can now simulate logging in as a newly onboarded employee (Their name was included in the names.txt list, and their account was automatically created using the PowerShell provisioning script on the Domain Controller). From the Windows 10 client VM, I can now log in as that user on a company-owned device just as it would occur during a real onboarding process.
