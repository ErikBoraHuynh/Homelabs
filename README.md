# Homelabs

Welcome to my Homelabs repository — a personal cybersecurity lab environment where I explore, experiment, and strengthen my technical skills through **hands-on practice**.  This repository documents my learning journey as I build, test, and secure systems to better understand how real-world cybersecurity concepts are applied.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Develop **practical experience** in cybersecurity tools, frameworks, and techniques.
- Reinforce knowledge from **CompTIA Security+**, **networking**, and **incident response** principles.
- Simulate **real-world attack and defense scenarios** in a controlled, ethical environment.
- Document findings, configurations, and lessons learned from each lab.
- Build a **portfolio of hands-on projects** to demonstrate real-world capability.  
- Encourage continuous learning and knowledge sharing.
