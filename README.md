# Homelabs

Welcome to my Homelabs repository where I document completed and ongoing homelabs to strengthen my technical skills through hands-on experience.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Develop **practical experience** in cybersecurity tools, frameworks, and techniques.
- Reinforce knowledge from **CompTIA Security+**, **networking**, and **incident response** principles.
- Simulate **real-world attack and defense scenarios** in a controlled, ethical environment.
- Document **findings, configurations, and lessons learned** from each lab.
- Build a **portfolio of hands-on projects** to demonstrate real-world capability.  
- Encourage **continuous learning** and knowledge sharing.
